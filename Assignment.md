# E-Commerce Website Project

## Assignment Overview

### Objective

Aspiring entrepreneurs often face challenges when launching their own businesses. In this assignment, you're tasked with building your e-commerce website from scratch. Despite having all other aspects in place, the missing element is a website. Due to budget constraints, the decision has been made to take matters into your own hands and develop the website independently.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Planning

Using pen and paper, draw an outline of the key features and design elements for your e-commerce website. Include a sketch of your homepage layout. The homepage should feature:

1. Hero section
2. Featured products section
3. 2 banners showcasing events/sales
4. Newsletter form
5. Consistent footer across all pages

Extend this process to sketch other pages as well, such as Shop, Blog, About Us, Contact Us, and Cart. Submission requires a photo/scan of your sketch, which will be graded along with other tasks.

### Task 2: HTML Structure

You are provided with an HTML file ('index.html'). Fill out the missing parts, including linking the Bootstrap stylesheet and JavaScript. Ensure that your HTML includes a navigation bar linking to:

1. Home page (with all elements from the sketch).
2. Shop page (displaying all products; clicking on a product goes to its description page).
3. Blog page (showcasing blog cards with image, title, description, and a “continue reading” button).
4. About Us page (business description)
5. Contact Us page
6. Cart page (product details table, apply coupon form, cart total, a “Proceed to Checkout” button)

### Task 3: CSS Styling

Develop a CSS file ('styles.css') to style your HTML structure. Pay attention to:

- A consistent color scheme and typography reflecting your brand. You may use coolors.co or myspace.color to generate a color palette.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.
- Extra: Use transitions and animations for a polished user experience.

### Task 4: Vanilla JavaScript Functionality

Write a JavaScript file ('script.js') to add dynamic functionality to your website. Implement the following:

1. Product Data: Define an array of at least 5 objects representing your products. Each object has an id, name, description, a Boolean to check availability, and an order quantity.
2. Display Products: Write a function to dynamically display the products on the page. Use the product data array to generate HTML of each product card and append it to the ‘#products’ section.
3. Add to Cart: Implement a function that adds a product to the shopping cart when the “Add to Cart” button is clicked. Update the cart and keep track of the total price.
4. Display Cart: Write a function that displays the items added to the cart on the corresponding HTML page. Update the cart total dynamically.
5. Checkout: Implement a function that simulates a checkout process. Display a confirmation message and clear the cart when the “Checkout” button is clicked.
